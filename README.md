====================

This is my Wordpress Theme for my personal website.
Feel free to play around with the theme and the code.

If you want to include the theme into your Wordpress site, here is what you need to do:

- put the cr2013 and the plugin folder into your wp-content folder
- activate the plugins "References" and "Simple contact form shortcode"
- create the pages home, blog, portfolio, contact and select the right template in the page settings
- the contact page does not need a template, just put the shortcode for the plugin inside the content: [contact email="your@email.address"]
- create a menu and include the pages you have created before
- choose the given theme menu location in the menu settings ("mainnav")
- in line 86 in the theme's functions.php i define the body classes for the pages. Replace the page IDs with your own ones (i know this is not pretty and i will update this when i find some time)
- create some references from the new WP meneu item "References"

Have fun!
